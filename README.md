# Nathan Katzman

* One of my personal intrests is that I like to hike on trails that can lead to a beach or lead to the top of a peak.

* Another personal intrest of mine is that I like to swim by swimming laps around a pool.

* My third personal intrest is that I like to research geography and historical facts since I find it intresting to read and gives me more insight on the world.

## Technical Background

For my technical background, I have had alot of experience with programming. I started four years ago, and since then, I used C/C++, Python, Javascript, Go/Golang, SQL/SQLite, HTML, CSS, github, Flask, Ghidra and docker. I hope I can improve on some of these skills during the semester.
