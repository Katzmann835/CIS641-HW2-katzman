* One of my personal intrests is that I like to hike on trails that can lead to a beach or lead to the top of a peak.

* Another personal intrest of mine is that I like to swim by swimming laps around a pool.

* My third personal intrest is that I like to research geography and historical facts since I find it intresting to read and gives me more insight on the world.

## Technical Background

For my technical background, I have had alot of experience with programming. I started four years ago, and since then, I used C/C++, Python, Javascript, Go/Golang, SQL/SQLite, HTML, CSS, github, Flask, Ghidra and docker. I hope I can improve on some of these skills during the semester.

## Term Project

The term project, we have decided to create a journaling app. The app will be ran through IOS. The journal will allow the user to log into a specific account. Then, the user should be able to access the journal and be allowed to type their thoughts, similiar to a dictionary. The app itself can suggest prompts in order to influence what the user will write about to motivate the user to journal more frequently. The app once you are finished will allow you to send, and determine if you want it priviate or public, then let you reset. Once you are done, the app will let you log out.
